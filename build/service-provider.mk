# Service Providers
#
# This sections defines service providers connection settings such as:
# - controller address
# - credentials
# - deployment profiles
# - rootfs: profile specific files, certificates, keys
#
# Environment variable SERVICE_PROVIDERS defines the list of service providers
# that will be included. If not defined this section is skipped. Value ALL
# can be used to include all providers found in the service-provider path.
# When using the ALL value, the providers are included in alphabetic order,
# to adjust the order the priority tokens can be specified before ALL
# example: SERVICE_PROVIDERS = "primary ALL"
#
# For each PROVIDER specified in SERVICE_PROVIDERS, a provider specific file is included
#   - service-provider/PROVIDER/build/provider.mk
# and a provider specific rootfs dir will be included for rootfs preparation
#   - service-provider/PROVIDER/rootfs
#
# The provider.mk can define some of these variables:
#
# VALID_IMAGE_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES : append list of valid profile names
# CONTROLLER_ADDR
# BACKHAUL_SSID
# BACKHAUL_PASS
# PROVIDER_BACKHAUL_CREDS : space delimited list of SSID:PASS pairs
#   Note: old format was ';' delimited list of SSID;PASS pairs
#         and is converted automatically to the new format
#   All provider defined PROVIDER_BACKHAUL_CREDS are automatically appended
#   to MULTI_BACKHAUL_CREDS
# ROOTFS_PROFILE_COMPONENTS : additional, profile or provider specific rootfs components
#
# Note: profile names across all specified service providers must be unique otherwise
# the settings would get overwritten. If a duplicate profile is detected the build
# is aborted with an error
