Description:
    - Script checks if wireless client is connected to DUT.
Arguments:
    -h  show this help message
Testcase procedure:
    - On DEVICE: Run: ./${manager_setup_file} (see ${manager_setup_file} -h)
            Create Radio/VIF interface
                Run: ./${create_rad_vif_if_file} (see ${create_rad_vif_if_file} -h)
            Create Inet entry for VIF interface
                Run: ./${create_inet_file} (see ${create_inet_file} -h)
            Create Inet entry for home bridge interface (br-home)
                Run: ./${create_inet_file} (see ${create_inet_file} -h)
            Add bridge port to VIF interface onto home bridge
                Run: ./${add_bridge_port_file} (see ${add_bridge_port_file} -h)
            Update Inet entry for home bridge interface for dhcpd (br-home)
                Run: ./${create_inet_file} (see ${create_inet_file} -h)
   - On RPI Client:
                 Run: /.${client_connect_file} (see ${client_connect_file} -h)
